/**
 * Suppresses log spam from a confirmed <strong>Mojang engine bug</strong>,
 * not a Tessera bug -- see
 * <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-293754">MC-293754</a>.
 *
 * <h2>What this bug is</h2>
 * Since 1.21.5 pre-release 2 (introduced as a side effect of a workaround
 * for a separate, unrelated bug,
 * <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-280482">MC-280482</a>),
 * vanilla Minecraft's own GL debug-message plumbing
 * ({@code com.mojang.blaze3d.platform.GlDebug}) logs a specific
 * {@code GL_INVALID_OPERATION} message with a hardcoded, non-descriptive
 * error context of literally the string {@code "(null)"} -- confirmed
 * reproducible on stock, completely unmodded Minecraft (see the Mojang bug
 * tracker report and multiple independent player reports across Intel,
 * AMD, and Nvidia hardware). Because the context is always {@code (null)},
 * there is no way -- from mod code, a debug label, or anything else --  to
 * make this specific message identify its real call site; the placeholder
 * is baked into vanilla's own error-formatting call, not left blank by
 * whichever GL call triggered it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is filtered here instead of "actually fixed"</h2>
 * This class only ever silences the message; it cannot and does not touch
 * whatever underlying (harmless, per Mojang's own workaround-side-effect
 * explanation) GL state transition trips the bug. Filtering only the exact
 * byte-for-byte message text --
 * {@code "Error has been generated. GL error GL_INVALID_OPERATION in
 * (null): (ID: 173538523) Generic error"} -- (see {@link #KNOWN_BENIGN_MESSAGE})
 * rather than the id (1282) or type (ERROR) alone is deliberate: id 1282 /
 * GL_INVALID_OPERATION is an extremely common, generic error code covering
 * many genuinely different failure modes elsewhere in the engine and in
 * other mods -- filtering on id or type alone would silence real,
 * unrelated GL errors that happen to share the same code. An exact-string
 * match against this one specific message text, checked in this filter's
 * own {@link #filter} implementations before any decision is made, is the
 * narrowest match that still reliably catches every instance of this
 * exact known-benign message and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>If Mojang ever changes this message's wording (e.g. fixing the bug,
 * or changing what "(null)" reads as), this filter simply stops matching
 * and every message reverts to logging normally -- it does not need to be
 * removed for that to happen safely, though it should be removed once the
 * underlying engine bug is confirmed fixed in whatever Minecraft version
 * this mod eventually targets, since a stale exact-string filter is dead
 * weight once its target string no longer occurs.
 *
 * <h2>How this attaches</h2>
 * {@link #install()} attaches this as a
 * {@link AbstractFilter} to the
 * {@link LoggerConfig} for the specific logger name backing
 * {@code com.mojang.blaze3d.platform.GlDebug}'s SLF4J logger (SLF4J is a
 * facade; Minecraft's actual backend is Log4j2, already on the runtime
 * classpath -- no new dependency needed), via the supported
 * {@code Configuration#getLoggerConfig(String)} lookup rather than the
 * internal-only {@code core.Logger#addFilter}. This only affects that one
 * named logger (or its nearest configured ancestor, in the fallback case
 * documented on {@link #install()}), not the global root logger or any
 * other class's logging -- every other mod/engine warning and error,
 * including Tessera's own, logs completely unaffected.
